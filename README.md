# Synapsis - An Acerola Jam 0 entry
Dive into a puzzling yet minimalist world of interesting rooms to solve filled with secrets. Using "anomalies", find your way through each level to reach the end. Be mindful however, these anomalies have unpredictable effects on the environment around you.

**This game was made in 2 weeks as part of the Acerola Jam 0**, using Unreal Engine 5 as my engine of choice (my first game using this engine post-Unity swap!) Apart from some animations taken from Mixamo (using my own custom character for this jam as the uploaded rig) and the font (taken from Google Fonts), ***all assets are 100% created by myself during the 2 week period of the jam (models, code, character, music, and SFX!)*** ALL done live on stream! Find my channel with the VODs here: https://twitch.tv/mikedabird! (they expire after 2 weeks on Twitch, but planning to post the archive up on YouTube at some point like for my past Jam)

The game features 5 levels in a prototype stage and also has a **Speedrun Timer!** post your best times in the comments here or on the jam submission page!

*Also, don't be surprised if after the jam I improve the character I made for this jam to make it available for cheap / free as a VRChat avatar base for the lols XvX*

## As part of the jam, this version of the game is posted publicly on GitHub (even if optional now) with all source files for the duration of the jam. I retain the rights to all assets within this repository except for the Mixamo animations used and the font of the game.
